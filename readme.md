#Code Sample

Here is an API-scraping script I helped develop this recent summer. The script ingests a pre-made dataframe of URLs for weather.gov's API that corresponds to weather forecasts for different locations throughout the US. The results of these API calls were put into a wide dataframe that would be used for a weather hazard project in our department. For security purposes, I cannot make further details about my experience public, but would be happy to discuss them further in private!
